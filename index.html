                    <p>According the Wikipedia, the 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen,
                        Mystic Square and many others) is a
                        sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile
                        missing. The
                        puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles,
                        the puzzle
                        is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or
                        16-puzzle
                        named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle
                        is to place
                        the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.
                        I am glad to present you my vision of the realization of this game.
                    <p>Hope you enjoy! Have a good time while playing it!(as much as did I while coding it:)</p>
